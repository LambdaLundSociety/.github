# Lambda Society
## Welcome to Lambda Society in association with Lund University

Welcome to Lambda Society, the premier student data science organization at Lund University. We are a group of motivated individuals who are passionate about harnessing the power of data to drive innovation and impact. Our mission is to foster a community of learners and practitioners, to promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and to provide opportunities for all who are interested to grow their skills and make real-world contributions to the field. Join us and be a part of this exciting journey!

We believe in hands-on learning and strive to provide our members with practical, real-world experience. That's why we host a variety of workshops and events focused on different data science skills, from programming to data visualization to machine learning. Whether you're just starting out or looking to refine your skills, there's something for everyone.

In addition to our workshops, we also collaborate on projects that allow our members to apply what they've learned in a meaningful way. These projects are designed to be part of a professional's personal portfolio, showcasing their abilities and demonstrating the impact they can make. By participating in these projects, members gain valuable experience working with real data and developing solutions to real-world problems. 

Our organization's GitHub repository serves as a hub for all of our code and projects, making it easy for members to access and learn from each other's work. By contributing to our repository, you'll be able to showcase your skills and help others grow their own. Whether you're working on a personal project or collaborating with your fellow members, sharing your code with the community is a key part the experience.
